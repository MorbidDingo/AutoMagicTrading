- Make a custom ML Object Recognition method.
- The custom model shall be able to accept input data in image (png, jpeg) format
- The train data will only have a glimpse of the object only given in Reference (Bearish Engulfing.png)
- The train data will be classified as per the content it contains
- The test data will a larger image of a whole chart given in Reference (JSW_2022-11-23_21-40-12.png)
- The model shall be able to recognize the object (provided to it in train data) and give the output accordingly.

Some points in which there is confusion:
1. If the model can work in real - time charts by analyzing and finding the train data in them.
2. Creating label for every type of train data to show them as input.
3. To use the label as a keyword to do further programming.
